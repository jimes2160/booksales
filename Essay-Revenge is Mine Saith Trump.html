In 2005 Trump gave a motivational speech to a large number of people in Loveland Colorado. Trump told the audience, <q>I have to tell you about losers. I love losers because they make me feel so good about myself</q>. Trump advised his audience to trust no one, especially good employees. <q>Be paranoid,</q> he said, <q>because they are going to try to fleece you.</q> Trump recommended revenge as a business policy. <q>Get even,</q> he said, <q>If somebody screws you us, you screw &apos;em back ten times over. At least you can feel good about it. Boy, do I feel good.</q> (The Making of Donald Trump by David Cay Johnston, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, pages 21-24 and 38-39)<br><br>
In his book Think Big, co-authored by Bill Zanker, founder of The Learning Annex, Trump wrote in chapter 6 (titled Revenge), <q>I always get even</q>. He describes how he hired a woman away from her government job and <q>gave her a great job at the Trump Organization, and over time she became powerful in real estate. She bought a beautiful home.</q> When Trump got in financial trouble he asked her to make a phone call to an extremely close friend of hers who held a powerful position at a big bank and who would have done what she asked. She told Donald that she could not do it. Trump fired her. He said, <q>she had turned on me after I had done so much to help her. I had asked her for one favor in return and she turned me down flat. She ended up losing her home. Her husband, who was only in it for the money, walked out on her and I was glad. Over the years many people have called asking for a recommendation for her. I only gave her bad recommendations. I can&apos;t stomach disloyalty &hellip; And now I go out of my way to make her life miserable.</q><br><br>
In the same chapter Trump writes, <q>I love getting even when I get screwed by someone - yes, it is true. Always get even. When you are in business you need to get even with people who screw you. You need to screw them back fifteen times harder &hellip; go for the jugular, attacked them in spades!</q> In the book the Art of the deal, Trump writes about his lawyer Roy Cohn, who had known connections with mobsters in New York City and Atlantic City, <q>you could count on him to go to bat for you,</q> Trump wrote. Loyalty is far more important than <q>all the hundreds of respectable guys who make careers out of boasting about their uncompromising integrity but have absolutely no loyalty.</q> Of course, that is the perspective we expect from mobsters, dictators, and others whose primary regard is for unflinching support, not for allegiance to truth or facts. <br><br>
