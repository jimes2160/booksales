(mm )- In his book Think Big, Trump wrote in chapter 6 (titled Revenge), “I always get even”. He describes how he hired a woman away from her government job and “gave her a great job at the Trump Organization, and over time she became powerful in real estate. She bought a beautiful home.” When Trump got in financial trouble he asked her to make a phone call to an extremely close friend of hers who held a powerful position at a big bank and who would have done what she asked. She told Donald that she could not do it. <br>
Trump fired her. He said, “she had turned on me after I had done so much to help her. I had asked her for one favor in return and she turned me down flat. She ended up losing her home. Her husband, who was only in it for the money, walked out on her and I was glad. Over the years many people have called asking for a recommendation for her. I only gave her bad recommendations. I can&apos;t stomach disloyalty… And now I go out of my way to make her life miserable.” <br>
In the same chapter Trump writes, “I love getting even when I get screwed by someone - yes, it is true. Always get even. When you are in business you need to get even with people who screw you. You need to screw them back fifteen times harder … go for the jugular, attacked them in spades!” <br><br>
