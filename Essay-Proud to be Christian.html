<b>Proud to be Christian: A satirical description of the fawning and slavish support of many Christians for their new Messiah and God-King. Then again, maybe it is more factual than satirical.</b><br><br>
Out with the old and in with the new. We have a new Messiah who we know is the chosen one of God because our televangelist and conservative pastors told us so and our new Messiah claimed the title. Jesus, the old Messiah that God dumped on us two millennia ago, has been hindering us from using the admittedly spiritually bankrupt but highly effective tactics of lying, deceit, division, racial attacks, disinformation and other questionable, immoral, and illegal modes of political behavior. Our new Messiah understands that we desperately need to use these tactics to make sure we impose our superior values upon American society. We represent the special and holy truth that God reveals to his white children and that confers upon us the right and authority to use any tactic necessary to get our way, because we are God&apos;s favorite people. The old Messiah that God gave us long ago was a weakling, but the new Messiah is strong. The old Messiah was humble, but the new Messiah is proud beyond imagination. The old Messiah never used his authority and spiritual power to crush those in government who dared not accept his holy word, but with the new Messiah we can destroy the political and personal future of any person who dares to think differently than us. What a sense of relief to be free from the puny pathetically humble Nazarene, a wannabe second-rate Messiah who thought a high standard of morality and being good to others mattered in this world. <br><br>
We realize that the first Messiah made a great mistake by not bowing to the efforts of Judas to force Jesus to exert political and military power to bring his kingdom to the earth (Matthew 26:14-16 and Matthew 26:47-56 ; Mark 14:10-11 and Mark 14:43-50). Our new Messiah will not make the same mistake. Thank you, Lord, for delivering this new political Messiah to lead us as we force our version of your kingdom upon this nation. We ask you to sanitize this nation by removing the infestation of ungodly disgusting heathens, especially those non-white inferior beings that have already infiltrated our ranks and those genetically defective criminals who seek refuge at our southern border. We absolve our new Messiah from responsibility for leading the effort to quash the Senate-passed immigration bill that would have effectively stopped the uncontrolled flow of immigrants. He needed to put himself before the country so that he can continue to use the border problem as a campaign issue. It would not be right to share credit for passing such good and needed legislation while he is campaigning (oo ). Jesus was a big disappointment but we know our new Messiah will not fail us. We praise and glorify this proud bigger-than-life man recently convicted for sexual assault (aa ), a true role model for our sons who teaches our daughters their place in society. We sincerely believe that you gave him the authority to grab the genitals (i ) of any of those fat ugly lowlife horse-face slobs (e ) whenever and wherever his holy desire leads him. This special wonderful man who ridicules people with broken bodies (w ) in a bid to score political points and who calls our nation&apos;s military personnel who died in war suckers and losers (b ) has earned our support by his holy words. We may appear to be sick sheep that are willing to laugh at and encourage his outrageous immoral behavior and comments but we know in our hearts that you approve of our love for this new Messiah. <br><br>
We know he has been well-trained and has had much practice as a con man, cheat and charlatan (gg ) and we accept that fact because we know those character traits are only tools granted by our God to our new Messiah so that he might fulfill his earthly mission. These are the perfect qualities he needs to overcome the heathens who cannot recognize or will not proclaim our special status and his divinity. We realize that he needs to extract power and wealth from the heathen by any means to weaken them and strengthen us, your chosen people. We pure white evangelicals and members of far-right extremist groups that are his true source of political power are ever ready to stand back and stand by (y ) until he calls us to do his bidding. We have waited so long for this new Messiah who will rule in our name. We are happy to pretend he is a fine Christian and make excuses for his grossly immoral and unrighteous behavior. We shout his praises from our pulpits and we oust those pastors who dare to confront us with the real truth that he is a liar beyond comparison (h ). We evangelicals are certain we are God&apos;s favored people, and because we are his favored ones, we have special dispensation to use evil to gain political power. <br><br>
God grants us this special favor because we and our new Messiah have held true to the core evangelical beliefs of white supremacy and white power (x ). We are proud that we consistently hold the most racist attitudes of any major American religious group (f ). It gives us the holy insight needed to recognize diversity as an insidious evil in our society (m ) and a threat to our whiteness and our special status as God&apos;s favorite people. We know our new spiritual leader speaks truth when he affirms to the world that immigrants are poisoning our pure blood (g ). We can only ask God to forgive us for our failure to misunderstand the deceptive commandment of our old Messiah to love our neighbors as ourselves (Matthew 22:37â€“39). In our new-found wisdom and the words of our new more-exciting Messiah, we now understand that Jesus meant for us to ration love to our white Protestant neighbors. <br><br>
Through our efforts, and our efforts alone, America will be saved. We have been called by you God to propel this lovable narcissistic misogynistic (j ) Messiah into the White House once again so he can complete his holy mission to dismantle American democracy and usher in his glorious reign as dictator (dd ). We recognize that he is the Chosen One of God (ff ) and that you made him for this purpose (ee ) because one of our most holy leaders told us so just before we discovered he enjoyed watching his wife have sex with the pool guy (l ). It is our Christian duty to glorify him with our praises and lift him above mere mortals so that he can sweep away our enemies in the government and declare himself dictator in support of our unique Christian theology. We have kissed this holy man&apos;s feet, we have kissed this holy man&apos;s ring, and we now kiss this holy man&apos;s ass in recognition of his authority over us and his right to rule in our name. For him we were willing to overthrow a free and fair election (z ). For him we continue to tell the Big Lie (k ) that he won the 2020 election in the hope that it will undercut faith in the electoral system of this country and allow us to exploit the indecision and confusion for the success of our holy mission. <br><br>
Our operatives in many states have worked tirelessly to limit, impede, distort and twist the intent and purpose of voting laws (hh ), especially the Civil Rights Voting Act of 1965, so that we can insure we retain political power in perpetuity. Our holy purpose will never be thwarted again. Our purpose is God&apos;s purpose, for God would not have sent us this wonderful new Messiah if it were not true. God speaks to us and tells us to support this terribly flawed but so holy Messiah (jj ). The word of God is revealed in our lives in those things which we hold dear and which our Messiah represents; the right to sexually assault (aa ), to defraud (r ), to refuse payment for work rendered (ii ), and to refuse to rent to African Americans and other undesirables (s ). We are secure in our God-given right to pretend that our new Messiah is a modern-day Cyrus, the very likeness of the Persian king who allowed the Israelites to return to the promised land and rebuild the temple in Jerusalem. He will lead us evangelicals back to our lost MAGA promised land (c ), back to the peaceful orderly days when blacks knew their place in our society and our newly formed churches reinterpreted your holy words to rightly justify slavery (o ). <br><br>
Our new Messiah is a God-King. We exercise our age-old right to install him as a modern-day Saul to rule over us. We chose to follow the path of the Israelites long ago and reject God in favor of a king because our king will also be our new Messiah (d ). We will be ever grateful as he releases us from the need to indulge in that nebulous and boring activity of stilling our mind and listening for God. We will be free to listen to the, admittedly at times, unintelligible rants of our Messiah-king and he will reinforce our self-centered thoughts and imaginations of our racial and spiritual superiority. We have every right to use all means legal and illegal to establish our new Messiah in a position of highest political power because we are special in the eyes of God and he understands that our will is his will. 
Our forefathers declared in the First Amendment to the Constitution that church and state should be separate (cc ), but we understand that they were not in tune with God who we know loves us best and his new representative on earth. We are convinced that he has authorized us to politically dominate America through our all-powerful evangelical church, the true church that can pass laws to uphold the special God-given rights of white Protestants and punish those disgusting immoral LGBTQ people (n ) who so offend us and are so far beneath us. These are the inalienable truths that set evangelicals above mere mortals. We have been given power from God on high to take control of the government of this country. We and only we can save this country, and only our new Messiah can give us ultimate political power so that we can impose our message on others, infiltrate the lives of every citizen of this country and remake their lives in our image. Although he is not of the true faith, we salute the long-dead Catholic Pope Sylvester I, who bargained with the Roman Emperor Constantine and exchanged independence, spiritual virtue, and wisdom for the material goods and wealth of the world (a ). <br><br>
It is only right that we raise our voices in prayer to express gratitude and praise for our new Messiah and his lackeys. We pray that you God will protect the chief strategist of our Messiah&apos;s previous political administration who must have had good reason to siphon off donated border wall funds to the tune of one million dollars for his personal use, and thank you for ensuring that our Messiah was able to grant him a pardon (p ). We ask you to protect the educational leader of our youth who only wanted to watch his wife getting screwed by the pool guy (l ). Most especially and importantly we ask you to protect our new Messiah and help him to continue to siphon off campaign donations to pay his mounting legal bills (q ) as he is indicted and tried for a very few of his many crimes. We pray that you will help him to continue duping and milking the faithful so that he can siphon off more of our foolish campaign donations to pay the 5 million in penalties he owes the woman he sexually assaulted (aa ), the 83 million in penalties he owes after defaming the woman he sexually assaulted (bb ), the 355 million (not counting interest) in penalties he owes for his massively corrupt business schemes to defraud banks and other lenders for his personal profit (u ), and the potentially hundreds of millions in penalties to the Capitol police officers who are suing him for injuries sustained by the brutal attack of his loyal sycophants during their first insurrection attempt. <br><br>
We know he is really a good person at heart and as the Messiah has the right to take what he needs to fulfill his holy mission, so we won&apos;t let the truth of his criminal and immoral behavior lessen our enthusiasm for this Messiah we so badly want. We ask you God that you let him reopen the fraudulent university that defrauded thousands of students and cost our Messiah another 25 million in penalties (t ). These ungrateful wretches were offered the once-in-a-lifetime chance to bask in the radiance of the new Messiah and all they could think about was that they had been bilked out of their education tuition. We are so proud that he has written in his published book Think Big that we should show no mercy and should seek revenge on any person who will not declare absolute loyalty to him (mm ). He was right to destroy the careers of Ukrainian-born Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman (Director for European Affairs for the United States National Security Council), Gordon Sondland (US Ambassador to the European Union), Marie Louise Yovanovitch (US Ambassador to Ukraine), and others who refused to keep quiet about his attempt to force President Zelenskyy of Ukraine to manufacture political dirt on his opponent in exchange for the release of desperately needed military aid. That was such sweet revenge when Russia invaded an unready Ukraine and killed thousands upon thousands of its citizens who thought our Messiah cared about their struggle for freedom and democracy. He is our Messiah and ours alone, and to hell with our democratic neighbors. <br><br>
The old weak Messiah told us to be merciful and that revenge was the prerogative of God, but what did he know and look where it got him? It got him death on a cross, when he could have had a magnificent penthouse suite with an unparalleled view of the skyline of Jerusalem. What a fool he was compared to our new Messiah. We ask you to protect him and to protect the more than one thousand insurrectionists who stormed and defiled the Capitol (v ) and more than thirty close advisors, enablers and partners in crime of our new Messiah who were (pick one or more) indicted, tried, convicted and jailed because they were caught doing his dirty work (kk ). They were only trying to steal an election and corrupt the government to his and our benefit. We thank you that he was able to pardon some of them minutes before he unwillingly left office in January 2021 (ll ). And last but not least we ask you to protect our repeatedly indicted and convicted Messiah (nn ) and help him regain power so we can impose our will on the unholy masses that threaten America and allow us to impose on others the holy principles we profess but rarely put into practice. We accept and honor our transformation from disciples to sycophants. <br><br>
