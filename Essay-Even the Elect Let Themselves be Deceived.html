Somewhere back in church or Sunday School it slowly began to sink into my head that Jesus was not just about me, but was about how much I love my neighbor and how much I am willing to serve and help another person in need. He held up love and service as the ideal spiritual qualities that a person can hold and demonstrated those traits throughout his life. Not that I am supposed to do everything for others, but that I am supposed to offer help when it is needed and be sure that my actions do not harm others. By extension that also means to ensure that the policies of those I elect provide equal opportunities for material advancement to every person in this country, give support and help to the poor when necessary, and ensure that the justice and financial system is not rigged to discriminate against anyone. The actions of the Trump administration severely eroded the American ideal of equal opportunity for material advancement and equal justice under law for every citizen. The subtle and not-so-subtle support of white supremacist attitudes and racial bias and the placement of political appointees who share these offensive attitudes have demeaned our nation. <br><br>
It bothers me that I have sat for years in Sunday School both as leader and participant and listened to Christians who seem to be trying to live by the precepts of love thy neighbor, kindness towards others, do no harm, treat others as I would like then to treat me, etc, etc, only to find that all of those qualities are apparently meaningless window dressing when it comes to politics. The immoral and corrupt nature of Trump is blatant and beyond anything I have seen in my lifetime for any person elected to hold a high public office, far surpassing the criminally corrupt Richard Nixon, yet he seems to be some sort of modern Messiah to too many Christians. More than thirty of his closest associates and best buddies, lawyers and confidants from his corrupt business ventures and term in the White House are already convicted felons because of their willingness to lie and break laws for him. It seems surreal to me that so many Americans today have so little respect for the rule of law and the Constitution. American democracy is at a huge risk of being corrupted to the breaking point by a severely-flawed narcissistic man who cares for nothing and no one but himself, and will do anything to retain the power he desires above all else. His slavish followers continue to spout and promote the Big Lie to gain political advantage with the mindless voting masses that are willing to follow him through the gates of hell rather than use their minds to discern the evil that he embodies. <br><br>
