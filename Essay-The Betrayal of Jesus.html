The governor sat on his judgment seat before the nation and asked the people in a loud voice who they wanted to be released and elevated to the status of their moral, spiritual and political leader on the earth. On the one hand he put forward Jesus in whom he had found no guilt or guile, a righteous man called the Son of God, who had spent several years teaching men how to live in peace, to love God and neighbor, to serve the poor and oppressed, to welcome to the stranger and foreigner, calling out the hypocrisy of the holier-than-thou Pharisees, and showing the spiritual danger of immorality, wealth and power. On the other hand he offered Trump, a purely selfish and unholy man who had spent the past 40 years conning and cheating employees and contractors, preventing blacks from renting his properties, misrepresenting the value of his properties to get undeserved loans and to cheat on taxes, seeking revenge as a way of business and personal life, promoting and glorifying himself above all, including God, lying for profit, pleasure and self-aggrandizement, spewing racist hatred and division, pandering to extreme right militias, committing criminal activities in business and government, and undermining American democracy and its legal system. <br><br>
The wealthy and powerful Evangelical religious leaders and televangelists, with their politically savvy deacons, tax-exempt status and control of super PACs for political influence, urged their church members to demand that they be given Trump. The governor could not believe the choice of the Evangelicals and other conservative Christians, so again asked which of the two they wanted him to release, and they again shouted, <q>Give us Trump.</q> Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ he asked. And the Evangelicals shouted and exclaimed, <q>Let Him be crucified</q> and <q>His blood be on us and on our children. Trump is more important to us. We can achieve our hearts desire with Trump as our political leader.</q><br><br>
