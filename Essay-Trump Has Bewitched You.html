The following paragraph is extracted from an article by Chris Thurman published in The Christian Post called <q>You Foolish Evangelicals, Trump Has Bewitched You</q>. Chris, a psychologist and author of The Lies We Believe, has written a strong article speaking truth to Evangelicals who intentionally close their eyes to the immoral, corrupt and outright evil nature that defines Donald Trump and refuse to demand moral and legal accountability from him. These Evangelicals fool no one but themselves. They espouse their sanctified standards for family values, and denounce Obama as a dictator for daring to extend health care to disadvantaged poorer families. They praise, pray over and lay hands on their self-proclaimed holy one who wonders aloud to his lawyer how they can believe such bulls**t. <br><br>
The Bible says, <q>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness</q> (Isaiah 5:2). In supporting Trump, Evangelicals have called him good when he is evil, light when he is darkness. This is especially disconcerting given that Christians claim to have the Holy Spirit inside of them, part of whose function is to guide us to truth and convict us of sin. Christians, of all people, should be the most discerning about a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing. Trump-supporting Evangelicals would be wise to ask themselves why so many secular mental health professionals who supposedly are not indwelt by the Holy Spirit see Trump as an evil, malignant narcissist while so many Christians keep sticking their head in the sand and deny it all. <br><br>
