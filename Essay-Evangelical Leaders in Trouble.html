There have been several instances of televangelists facing moral controversies over the years. Here are about eighty televangelists who have engaged in criminal activities, indulged in questionable behavior, and faced moral controversies because of their failure to hold true to the teachings of Jesus. Several of them are from the prosperity gospel movement; the same denomination that appealed to Fred Trump, father of Donald Trump. For a while, Fred and his family attended church at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, New York, and his pastor was Norman Vincent Peale, a major proponent of the prosperity gospel movement. Of course, Evangelicals are quick to point out that God uses evil men to accomplish his plans for mankind. What a sick and lame excuse for their slavish worship of Trump, who is little different from their corrupt and contemptible "spiritual" leaders.<br><br>
