Donald Trump&apos;s base of support is concentrated in the more conservative wing of the Republican Party, especially Evangelicals and alt-right white supremacists. Evangelicals certainly understand the power of words; in the Book of John, Jesus is called the Word. The voices of their church leaders and pastors are supposed to inform the faithful and the world how much Evangelicals love God and honor the truth of his Word. The power of words is a topic that James, the brother of Jesus, thought was vitally important, so he had something to say about words when he wrote what became the Book of James in the New Testament. He compares careless words or inappropriate words to a spark that can set off a forest fire. He tells us that words of hate and divisiveness grow like a cancer and can corrupt and destroy entire societies. <br><br>
Consider some of the words and ideas from James 3:5-6 as presented in the Message Bible. It only takes a spark, remember, to set off a forest fire. A careless or wrongly placed word out of your mouth can do that. By our speech we can ruin the world, turn harmony to chaos, throw mud on a reputation, send the whole world up in smoke and go up in smoke with it, smoke right from the pit of hell. But that is not all. He speaks of lying and twisting the truth as the antithesis of wisdom, and that the folly of pretending to look better than others and trying to dominate others is a destructive personality trait. He makes it clear that the survival of a community or a society depends on treating others with dignity and honor. <br><br>
What about these thoughts from James 3:13-18. Do you want to be counted wise, to build a reputation for wisdom? Here is what you do: Live well, live wisely, live humbly. It is the way you live, not the way you talk, that counts. Mean-spirited ambition is not wisdom. Boasting that you are wise is not wisdom. Twisting the truth to make yourself sound wise is not wisdom. It is the furthest thing from wisdom; it is devilish and conniving animal cunning. Whenever you are trying to look better than others or get the better of others, things fall apart and everyone ends up at the other person&apos;s throat. Real wisdom, God&apos;s wisdom, begins with a holy life and is characterized by getting along with others. It is gentle and reasonable, overflowing with mercy and blessings, not hot one day and cold the next, not two-faced. You can develop a healthy, robust community that lives right with God and enjoy its results only if you do the hard work of getting along with each other, treating each other with dignity and honor. When your eyes are filled with the glory of Trump and your mind revels in his unending barrage of lies and deceit, you have strayed from the spiritual path and are in danger of losing your soul. Continue worshiping him at your peril.  <br><br>
A Christian community founded on the principle of Jesus the Christ as the incarnate Word of God will choose political leaders who they think will at least try to embody some of the moral principles they claim to hold dear. To do otherwise would be exceedingly hypocritical. Lying, or twisting the truth, is one way in which a dishonorable person will try to deceive others. A person who lies so naturally and consistently that they cannot stop lying is called a pathological liar. Trump&apos;s family and associates who are on record stating that Trump lies easily, willingly and often to get what he wants or to stroke his over-inflated ego include his former lawyer John Dowd, George Conway husband of presidential advisor Kellyanne Conway, his niece Mary Trump, his sister Maryanne Trump Barry, his communication chief Anthony Scaramucci, DHS Chief of Staff to the US Secretary of Homeland Security Miles Taylor, US National Security Advisor John Bolton, and his ex-lawyer Michael Cohen among many others. He has spewed out an astonishing 30,000 lies or deceptive statements in just the four years of his presidency, all documented by date and occasion and available for public scrutiny by any person who cares enough to do the research. <br><br>
