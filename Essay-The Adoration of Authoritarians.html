Evangelicals and like-minded conservative Christians found a new champion in a man who is the epitome of immorality, racism, narcissism and criminal behavior. The German Christian Faith Movement of the 1930&apos;s was in many ways similar to the recent Evangelical movement in America. The leaders of the German Christian Church saw a man of God in the underdog candidate Adolf Hitler during the 1933 elections, and gave their unabashed and fawning support to him during and after the election. Protestant pastors and theologians called him the "instrument of God", the "liberator of our people from their spiritual misery and division", and "a believing Christian". They even went so far as to state, "If the German who truly believed in Jesus could find the Spirit of the kingdom of God anywhere, he could find it in Adolf Hitler's movement." <br><br>
The rise of Donald Trump and the support and adoration of evangelical leaders for their new Messiah king is frighteningly similar to the rise of Adolf Hitler. American Christian conservative leaders and members stretch believability to the breaking point trying to see God&apos;s hand at work in Trump and claiming a spiritual kinship to the new leader. This Nazi-Evangelical analogy alone should be a wake-up call to evangelical leaders and church members who have discarded the teachings of Jesus in favor of the teachings of Trump. One might think that the analogy between the attitude of conservative Christians toward Trump and the attitude of German Christians toward Hitler is farfetched, but take a look at these excerpts from quotes made by Christian pastors and self-proclaimed voices of moral authority, who urged their church members and followers to embrace a new political leader they promoted as one chosen by God. <br><br>
Here are the edited but accurate quotes from prominent Christian leaders and public moral voices showing how they interpreted God&apos;s messages to them and perceive their role in identifying appropriate political leaders for their flocks. <br><br>
1- "God raised up ... Donald Trump." (Michele Bachmann, Evangelical and former U.S. representative) <br><br>
2- " ... No one could welcome January 30, 1933 [the date of Hitler&apos;s accession to power] more profoundly or more joyfully than the German Christian leadership." (Arnold Dannenmann, German Protestant theologian) <br><br>
3- "We thank God every day that he gave us a leader like President Trump." (Robert Jeffress, Southern Baptist pastor) <br><br>
4- "Adolf Hitler, with his faith in Germany, as the instrument of our God became the framer of German destiny and the liberator of our people from their spiritual misery and division." (Anna Ilgenstein-Ratterfeld, German Protestant theologian) <br><br>
5- "In the midst of despair, came November the 8th, 2016. It was on that day that God declared that the people, not the pollsters, were gonna choose the next president of the United States. And they chose Donald Trump." (Robert Jeffress, Southern Baptist pastor) <br><br>
6- "[Hitler is] the best man imaginable, a man shaped in a mold made of unity, piety, energy and strength of character." (Joachim Hossenfelder, German Protestant theologian) <br><br>
7- "[Trump is a bold man, a strong man, and an obedient man." (Kenneth Copeland, American televangelist) <br><br>
8- "Donald Trump actively seeks God&apos;s guidance in his life." (James Dobson, Evangelical Christian author) <br><br>
9 "God has righteously chosen [Trump] to affect the way that this nation goes forward." (Chuck Pierce) <br><br>
10- "[Hitler], the most German man, is also the most faithful, a believing Christian. We know that he begins and ends the course of his day with prayer, that he has found in the Gospel the deepest source of his strength." (Constantin Grossmann, German Christian Faith Movement Leader) <br><br>
11- "Donald Trump represents a supernatural answer to prayer." (James Robison). <br><br>
12- "If the German who truly believed in Jesus could find the Spirit of the kingdom of God anywhere, he could find it in Adolf Hitler&apos;s movement." (Julius Leutheuser, Lutheran Pastor) <br><br>
13- "I see this as a last-minute reprieve for America, and the Church." (Rodney Howard-Browne) <br><br>
14- Trump&apos;s victory "showed clear evidence of &apos;the hand of God&apos; on the election." (Franklin Graham) <br><br>
15- " ... in the pitch-black night of Christian church history, Hitler became like a wonderful transparency for our time, a window through which light fell upon the history of Christianity." (Siegfried Leffler, Lutheran Pastor) <br><br>
16- "God had raised up [Trump] for such a time as this." (Stephen Strang) <br><br>
17- "[God has granted us an] hour of grace through Adolf Hitler." (Siegfried Leffler, Lutheran Pastor) <br><br>
18- "God has once again raised his voice in a singular individual [Adolf Hitler]." (Siegfried Leffler, Lutheran Pastor) <br><br>
19- "[Trump] does look like he&apos;s the last hope." (Phyllis Schlafly) <br><br>
20- "God was raising up Donald Trump as he did the Persian king Cyrus the Great." (Lance Wallnau) <br><br>
There appears to be little difference between American Evangelicals today and German Christians in the 1930&apos;s. They both worked relentlessly to promote their God-blessed candidates, and with the election of the political underdogs Trump and Hitler, Christian conservatives from both countries fell over each other trying to be the first to see God&apos;s hand at work. They even competed to see who could heap the most praise on the new emerging leaders, and cozied up to the increasingly deranged and corrupt autocrats. <br><br>
It is obvious that Evangelical and other fundamental Christians found a new political champion in Donald Trump in 2016 despite his blatant immorality, racism, narcissism and criminal behavior. How far will Trump go along the path that Hitler blazed before the faithful wake up to their folly? Even in the 2024 election cycle many of them still see no reason to abandon their new Messiah even in the face of civil and criminal convictions and his role in the failure of the most stringent immigration bill in the past forty years to pass Congress. <br><br>
I invite you to read the book How Democracies Die to comprehend the fragility of democratic political systems and the sometimes catastrophic consequences that are precipitated when a small but committed minority of voters willingly let themselves be seduced by lies, deception and deceit perpetrated by political leaders who believe they are more important than the system or who manipulate the electorate for their own selfish need for personal and political power. As Jesus said, even the very elect are deceived (Matthew 24:24). <br><br>
