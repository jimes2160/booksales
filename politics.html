Democracy is fragile and the upcoming election is a test of the resolve of the American people to hold true to democratic principles or descend into autcracy under the leadership of a man who has been convicted in civl trial for sexual assault (NY), convicted in civil trial for financial fraud (NY), convicted in criminal trial for political hush money payment (NY), indicted for election fraud (GA), indicted for the Jan6 insurrection (DC), and indicted for theft of classified government documents (FL). It is also a referrendum that will decide if American Christians intend to abandon the teachings of Jesus, especially his second commandment to love thy neighbor, and embrace a new Messiah in the narcissistic and autocratic con man who is likely the most immoral and un-Christian political leader of our times. This election may very well determine whether Americans are committed to fulfilling the destiny of this great country by keeping it a becon of hope and democracy in a world of rising hatred and violations of human rights and societal, national and international norms. The Christian love of all things Trump and willingness to corrupt religious principles and political institutions to impose their worldview on America may well destroy the democratic foundations of this nation.
		<br><br>
<i>(Q) Is America fulfilling her destiny? ... (A) Is America as a whole? This is as has been given. If there is not the acceptance in America of the closer brotherhood of man, the love of the neighbor as self, civilization must wend its way westward ... What have ye done with the knowledge that ye have respecting the relationships of thy Creator to thy fellow man? [Edgar Cayce reading 3976-15_14 Jan 1934]</i>

        <h3><i><span class="mar">-- Evangelical Support of Donald Trump --</span></i></h3>
		<a href="Essay-The Betrayal of Jesus.html"><b>The Betrayal of Jesus</b></a>
		<br>
The astonishing and slavish Evangelical support for Donald Trump is an outright betrayal of Jesus and the moral and spiritual principles which he brought to the world and for which he gave his life.
		<br><br>
		<a href="Essay-Trump Has Bewitched You.html"><b>Trump Has Bewitched You</b></a>
		<br>
How did a group of people who claim devotion to Jesus let themselves be bewitched by the powers of evil? Were they simply foolish or did they intentionally embrace evil to get their hearts desire?

		<a href="Essay-The Adoration of Authoritarians.html"><b>The Adoration of Authoritarians</b></a>
		<br>
Take a look at these quotes from Christian leaders giving their support to their favorite political figure who they claimed were raised up by God to usher in his kingdom.

		<br>
Evangelical Christians certainly understand the power of words. Donald Trump certainly does, and uses them repeatedly to shape the minds of those he intends to use for his selfish purposes.
		<br><br>
		<a href="Essay-Even the Elect Let Themselves be Deceived.html"><b>Even the Elect Let Themselves be Deceived</b></a>
		<br>
Christians who should know better and who certainly have been taught better line up at the ballot box to vote for the opposite of love and in so doing, heap scorn upon their old Messiah as they embrace their new Messiah.
		<br><br>
		<a href="Essay-Proud to be Christian.html"><b>Proud to be Chrisitain</b></a>
		<br>
This is a satirical description of the fawning and slavish support of many Christians for their new Messiah and God-King. Then again, maybe it is more factual than satirical. Note: The many references are posted in the following essay, References for Proud to be Christian.
		<br><br>
		<a href="Essay-References for Proud to be Christian.html"><b>References for Proud to be Chrisitan/b></a>
		<br>

		<a href="Essay-Truth Is Not Welcome in Evangelical Churches.html"><b>Truth Is Not Welcome in Evangelical Churches</b></a>
		<br>
Two Evangelical pastors suffer for their honesty and while a depraved Evangelical leader proclaims Trump as the new Messiah while watching the pool guy do his wife. 
		<br><br>
		<a href="Essay-Evangelical Leaders in Trouble.html"><b>Evangelical Leaders in Trouble</b></a>
		<br>
No wonder Evangelicals find little fault in the gross and blantantly immoral behavior of Donald Trump. They are quite used to this same behavior from their frequently immoral leaders.
