When single-issue voters put party before county and ignore immoral and criminal behavior in politicians, they place democracy in a dangerous position. Christians chose to ignore the many warning signs that clearly showed Trump has always been unstable, a pathological liar, a corrupt businessman, a first-class narcissist who believes in his own self-interest and right to power above all else. They close their eyes to all of these severe character flaws and moral defects and declared him to be their God in the White House. Evangelical church leaders have duped themselves and their blindly trusting flocks into believing that Trump is the new savior. They have closed their moral senses, shut their eyes and ears and intellect to Trump&apos;s blatantly obvious and abundantly documented abuse of workers, abuse of women, abuse of power, abuse of immigrants, abuse of non-white citizens, and disregard of all common decency of behavior. They call him the Chosen One, a spit-in-the-face insult to Jesus the Christ who lived his life as an example of love, service, kindness, and a caring attitude toward others. <br><br>
Church members who have awakened to this gross moral error fear to raise their voice in protest because they will be criticized, ostracized and excommunicated by members of their congregation. Church leaders and members who now see the dystopia of the Trump presidency and realize the grave mistake Christians made by endorsing him are afraid to speak out for fear losing the support and respect of their fellow church members or fear losing their comfortable positions of religious power. Yet, there are some Evangelical Christian leaders who hold true to their moral principles, but they usually pay dearly for their honesty. It would be wonderful if more of them spoke out about the corruption of Christianity by Christians eager to embrace evil to gain political power and the danger to American democracy posed by a narcissistic president who cares nothing for the values Jesus taught, but delights in loyalty and the prospect of revenge. <br><br>
Chris Thurman writes: Jerry Falwell Jr. president of Liberty University criticized Martin Galli, former editor-in-chief of Christianity Today for writing an op-ed in which Galli stated Trump should be removed from office because of his blatant and unrepentant immorality. Rather than respond in a biblically solid and respectful way to Galli&apos;s opinion about the president, Falwell attacked both the messenger and the magazine he worked for, saying "Although Christians have never had a better champion in the White House than President Trump, a so-called Christian media outlet is using its platform to echo the radical progressive left in demanding his removal from office, stalking the Internet like a wolf in sheep&apos;s clothing." Christianity Today isn&apos;t a so-called Christian media outlet - in fact, it is probably the most influential Christian magazine in the United States (Sider, 2020, page 133). <br><br>
What isn&apos;t mentioned in the book is that Jerry Falwell Jr. owed a huge debt of gratitude to Trump&apos;s lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, for intervening in an alleged extortion attempt by a man who often had sexual relations with Jerry&apos;s wife Becki over an 8-year period, while he, Jerry, watched (Cohen, 2020). No wonder Jerry felt he had to pander to Trump and encourage his fellow Evangelicals to support Trump&apos;s 2016 election campaign. He surely didn&apos;t want on Trump&apos;s bad side, a man known to use leverage over people to get what he wants and who willingly trashes the reputations of people who wouldn&apos;t do his bidding or who he felt had crossed him. It eventually all fell apart for Falwell anyway. Yet another “great” Evangelical leader turns out to be a scumbag. <br><br>
